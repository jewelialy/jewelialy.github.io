Assignment1

This assignment allowed us to practice using HTML and CSS. I correctly implemented five different CSS styles and was able to successfully upload the three pages to github. One aspect of this assignment I struggled with was when creating the CSS external style sheet. I initially used the inline style syntax to style my HTML files. I had to separate the various componenets of each of the three files so that they were in sync with the CSS style sheet. 
I went to office hours with Obaid to get help with the git commits and uploading my HTML local files to GitHub. 
I spent approximately 5 hours on this assignment.
